<p> 	To start off with, I heard about this trip from a professor in my religion class. Usually when I hear professors or students discuss events I just tune it out because I feel that they’re not for me. But, this particular trip caught my eye to begin with. The visits to theatres and many other things really did interest me; but that’s not the main reason I wanted to go. To begin with, I thought this would be a fun trip but I was a little scared to leave the country and not be home for the whole summer. So, I pushed it out of my head; I tried at least. But, the trip to London just kept appearing. No matter how many times I threw the flyer away I found another one. After a massive amount of praying about this summer, since I’m always worried about what I’m going to do, all arrows pointed to this, even though I didn’t want to go. I continually pushed back but I decided if God’s pushing me towards something that it’s the best possible option for me. God kept telling me this was where I needed to be this summer, and it was on this trip. I can see the big man upstairs has something amazing in store for me on this trip!
The main reason I want to go on the trip is in order to grow as a person. When I am in my hometown, I feel my development as a person is stunted. I’m constantly put into a box of who I am; therefore, who I always will be. However, going on a trip across the world with people that I do not know gives a sense of freedom and chance. Instead of being trapped in a box to who I am and what I should do in every situation I would be able to explore who I am trying to be. I found this transition from high school to college at Gonzaga University an amazing way to change myself. There were things I hated about myself going from high school to college which I was able to change, such as my view of relationships, what I thought was the most important things to have in life and much more. Going into the transition at college I was able to change a myriad of things about myself, and then surround myself with people who were able to support that lifestyle. I am hoping to do this same thing again, but just across the world! For instance, I currently feel that I am too selfish with my time. Most of the time, I believe I should finish my homework before I should see any of my friends at school. But, I think people should be my priority, then school. Obviously, I’m at Gonzaga for school but the impact I make on people studying in my room versus helping one of my friends through a tough time is drastically in favor of my friends. Being a more selfless person may seem easy but it’s hard to do that around people that have set expectations about me when I don’t even know exactly want with my life is difficult to do. Along with being selfless, I plan to get closer to God with more alone time. So often I just forget to sit down for a while to pray and listen. I’m always doing something at school and at home. But, I believe with more free time, and friends like me, who are pursuing God, it will be easier to spend more time in his presence and draw closer to him. I will try to put an emphasis on the “spiritually” of this trip for sure; I would say my main objective of this trip is to draw closer to him through this trip. Overall, being around people who want to grow in their faith while taking a religion class to enhance my knowledge would be very beneficial for me to experience.

  Now the question is “what do I bring to the trip”? The one thing that has always made me stand out is the energy that I bring with me where ever I go. Most people in my field of study, computer science, are introverted, non-social people. But, I am a very social person. When I took the Myers-Brigg test I was rated a 95% extrovert! I am always up for a spontaneous adventure or new experience, which I’m sure this trip would be full of. Whether it’s traveling to the Harry Potter castle or going to visit my old exchange student Djordje in Serbia or just about anything else, I am always looking for more adventures. My energy tends to be contagious, leading everyone else to being more extroverted too. Along with my energy I am a very happy, level headed and positive person. When events tend to go wrong I will almost always make a laugh out of it then move onto the next available option. For instance, I was looking for a friend’s house in the deep snow in a little Volvo. My friend and I had no service and the house we were looking for was so new that it was not on the Maps app. After getting stuck in the snow my splash guard (4 by 2 feet piece of plastic under the car) falls off. Instead of losing my cool, since I’d just messed up my beautiful car, I was able to evaluate the best option to do next. We were able to get my car out of the icy snow and eventually problem solved our way to finding the house. I’m sure in London there will be many, many times that we will get lost or just be put into an awkward or bizarre situation; I would feel very comfortable trying to find a way to solve the problem! So, as a participant my energy, happiness and level-headedness would be a major asset to have while traveling to such an unfamiliar but exciting place.
I am looking forward to a trip to London so that I may grow as a person, grow in my faith and love all of the people around me in the process.
