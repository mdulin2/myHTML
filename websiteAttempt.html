  Team history[edit]
  Early years[edit]
  Gonzaga introduced a basketball program during the 1907–08 basketball season. During that season, they had no coach, but managed to achieve a record of 9–2 (.818).[4] In the 1908/09 season, George Varnell became the first official coach for Gonzaga, earning a 10–2 (.833) record during his only season with Gonzaga. Varnell was replaced by William Mulligan the following season, who acquired an 11–3 (.786) record.[5] Frank McKevitt took over for Mulligan during the 1910–11 basketball season, acquiring an 8–1 (.889) record.[5] From 1944 to 1994 the Bulldogs compiled a record of 628–531 (.542), earning regular season titles in 1965–66, 1966–67 and 1993–94. 1993–94 also saw the team qualify for its first postseason tournament, the NIT. A year later, the 1994–95 team would make the school's first appearance into the NCAA tournament, under coach Dan Fitzgerald.[6]
  Dan Monson (1997–1999)[edit]
  In 1997, Gonzaga assistant coach Dan Monson, the son of veteran Oregon and Idaho basketball coach Don Monson, became head coach of Gonzaga as Dan Fitzgerald wanted to focus on his athletic director's duties.[7] During his first season, Monson led the Zags to a 24–10 record and a WCC regular-season title, which was not enough to land Gonzaga an at-large bid into the NCAA Tournament.[7] However, the Bulldogs would earn a bid into the 1998 National Invitation Tournament, where they beat Wyoming 69–55 in the first round before falling to Hawai'i 78–70 in the second round.[8]
  During the 1998–99 season, the Bulldogs finished with a 28–7 record and the conference tournament championship, which gave Gonzaga a 10-seed into the 1999 NCAA Tournament.[9] In what would be the tournament's "Cinderella" run and Gonzaga's "coming out party" (Gonzaga has made the NCAA Tournament each year since) the Zags beat seventh-seeded Minnesota 75–63 in the first round and followed it with an 82–74 win over second-seeded Stanford to advance to the regional semifinals.[10] The Zags would go on to beat Florida 73–72 to advance to the regional finals after Casey Calvary tipped in the winning basket with four seconds remaining.[7] They trailed eventual national champion UConn by one point with a minute remaining before losing 67–62 in the regional finals.[11]
  Mark Few (1999–present)[edit]

  After Dan Monson took the head coaching position at Minnesota,[12] assistant coach Mark Few was named the new head coach on July 26, 1999.[13] In his inaugural season, Few led the Zags to a 26–9 record, which was highlighted by winning the WCC Tournament and advancing to the Sweet 16 of the 2000 NCAA Tournament with wins over Louisville and St. John's.[14]
  In the 2000–01 season, the Bulldogs faced a tough schedule highlighted by games against Arizona, Washington, Florida, and New Mexico.[15] Despite starting the season 5–1, the Zags dropped four of their next five games.[16] Gonzaga rebounded and finished the regular season 15–1[16] before winning their third consecutive WCC Tournament title.[17] The win gave the Bulldogs an automatic bid into the 2001 NCAA Tournament, where they were given a 12-seed.[18] In the first round game against fifth-seeded Virginia, Casey Calvary put back a blocked shot with nine seconds left to give the Zags an 86–85 victory.[19] Gonzaga would go on to beat 13th-seeded Indiana State 85–68 in the second round to advance to their third consecutive Sweet 16 appearance.[20] The Zags would go on to lose to defending national champion Michigan State 77–62 and finished the season with a 26–7 record.[21]
  Before the 2001–02 season started, the Bulldogs were unanimously favored to win the WCC title in the 2001–02 WCC preseason coaches poll.[22] Few led the Zags to a share of the WCC regular season title, as Pepperdine also had a 13–1 conference record.[23] The Bulldogs would avenge their only conference loss of the season by defeating Pepperdine 96–90 for their fourth straight WCC title.[24] The win gave the Zags an automatic bid as a six-seed in the 2002 NCAA Tournament, where they would face 11th-seeded Wyoming.[25] Despite beating the Cowboys in the 1998 National Invitation Tournament,[25] they would end up losing 73–66, marking the first time the Zags lost in the first round of the tournament in the Mark Few era.[26][27]
  In the 2002–03 season, Few led the Bulldogs to their fifth regular season title in six years with a 12–2 conference record.[28] Despite this, Gonzaga lost to San Diego in the WCC Tournament championship game 72–63,[29] marking the first time the Zags had lost in the championship game in four years.[30] Gonzaga garnered a nine-seed in the 2003 NCAA Tournament, where they beat Cincinnati 74–69 to advance to the second round of the tournament for the fourth time in five years.[31] The Bulldogs would go on to lose to Arizona 96–95 in double overtime to finish 24–9.[32][33]
  The 2003–04 season marked the first time that the team participated in the annual Battle in Seattle game.[34] Gonzaga faced third-ranked Missouri, who was the highest-ranked regular season opponent that the Zags had played against up to that point; they would go on to win the game in an 87–80 overtime victory.[35] This season marked the last time Gonzaga would play home games in the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre; their last game in the building took place February 28, 2004, where they beat Santa Clara 80–64.[36] The win gave the Bulldogs their first undefeated run through the WCC in school history with a 14–0 conference record.[36] Gonzaga would go on to receive an automatic bid into the 2004 NCAA Tournament with a two-seed, which was the highest seed they had received in school history in seven tournament appearances.[37] The Bulldogs would go on to beat 15th-seeded Valparaiso 76–49[38] before being upset in the second round by tenth-seeded Nevada 91–72, where they finished the season 28–3.[39]
  Gonzaga opened up the 2004–05 season with a home game against Portland State in the new 6,000-seat McCarthey Athletic Center on November 19, 2004.[40] Despite losing five seniors, including second-round NBA draft pick Blake Stepp,[41] Few was still able to lead the Zags to their ninth regular season title since 1994 with a 12–2 conference record.[42] The Bulldogs would go on to win their second straight WCC Tournament title,[43] giving them an automatic bid into the 2005 NCAA Tournament as a three-seed.[44] The Zags beat 14th-seeded Winthrop 74–64[45] before falling to Texas Tech 71–69 in the second round, where they ended the season with a 26–5 record.[46]

  Before the 2005–06 season got underway, Gonzaga junior Adam Morrison became the first player in team history to be named to the preseason Associated Press All-America team.[47] The Zags also received their highest preseason ranking in program history at number seven in the USA Today/ESPN preseason poll.[48] The Bulldogs captured their third straight WCC Tournament title when they beat Loyola Marymount 68–67 in the championship game.[49] They received an automatic bid into the 2006 NCAA Tournament as a three-seed, where they beat Xavier 79–75 in the first round.[50] The Zags would go on to beat Indiana Hoosiers 90–80,[51] where they would advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2001.[27] Despite being ahead by as many as 17 points, the Bulldogs ended their season in the Sweet 16 by losing to UCLA 73–71, finishing 29–4.[52][53]
  The 2006–07 season marked the first time that the Zags suffered at least ten losses in a season since the 1997–98 season.[54] Despite this, Few still led the Bulldogs to their seventh straight regular season title with a conference record of 11–3.[55] Gonzaga would go on to win the WCC Tournament for the fourth year in a row, being the only Division I school to do so that year.[56] They received an automatic bid into the 2007 NCAA Tournament, where they were given a 10-seed.[57] The Zags would end their season by losing in the opening round for the first time since 2001, as Indiana beat Gonzaga 70–57.[58]
  The 2007–08 team would go 25-8 but would lose in the Round of 64 to a Stephen Curry led Davidson team.
  After two disappointing seasons, the 2008–09 team would win both the WCC Regular Season Championship and the WCC Tournament Championship. Entering the NCAA Tournament as a #4 ssed, the team would reach the Sweet Sixteen before falling to eventual NCAA Champions North Carolina.
  For the next five seasons, The team would fail to advance past the Round of 32. However, the 2014–15 team would advance all the way to the Elite Eight before losing to eventual national champion Duke. This was the first time since 1999 that Gonzaga had advanced to the Elite Eight while also winning the WCC Regular Season and Tournament championships for the third consecutive season. The 2014–15 would also set the school record with wins in a single season with 35.
  The 2015–16 team advanced to the Sweet Sixteen only to fall to Syracuse by three points.
